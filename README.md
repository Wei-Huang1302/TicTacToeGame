# TicTacToeGame

Welcome! This is a tiny project created in C# .NET Framework to stimulate Tic Tac Toe game between two AIs. I created this game using 
MVVM pattern with least interaction with xaml.cs file. This means other users only need to design their UIs as all logics are handled in 
vm class.

## Installing

1. Ensure Visual Studio 2017 is installed.
2. .NET Framework is installed.
3. Clone the reop or download zipped code to your local path
4. Run it either in Release or Debug mode.
